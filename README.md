Goal of the Game: Kill all enemies on each level to proceed to the next level.   
If you die, it will respawn you back at the start of the level with what you   
entered the level with.  
  
Careful! Your own rocket explosions can hurt you!       
     
Most weapons have a secondary fire. If you melee with the alt fire and the  
enemy is low enough on health, you will perform a finishing move on them.   
Hard to pull off, but satisfying. You are invincible during rip and tear.     
  
There are 3 levels. Try to move slowly and not alert too many enemies at once.   
I suggest to use the shotgun that you pickup at the start.
